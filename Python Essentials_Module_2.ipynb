    "1. The print() function is a built-in function. It prints/outputs a specified message to the screen/consol window.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Built-in functions, contrary to user-defined functions, are always available and don't have to be imported. Python 3.8 comes with 69 built-in functions. You can find their full list provided in alphabetical order in the Python Standard Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To call a function (this process is known as function invocation or function call), you need to use the function name followed by parentheses. You can pass arguments into a function by placing them inside the parentheses. You must separate arguments with a comma, e.g., print(\"Hello,\", \"world!\"). An \"empty\" print() function outputs an empty line to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Python strings are delimited with quotes, e.g., \"I am a string\" (double quotes), or 'I am a string, too' (single quotes).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Computer programs are collections of instructions. An instruction is a command to perform a specific task when executed, e.g., to print a certain message to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In Python strings the backslash (\\) is a special character which announces that the next character has a different meaning, e.g., \\n (the newline character) starts a new output line.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Positional arguments are the ones whose meaning is dictated by their position, e.g., the second argument is outputted after the first, the third is outputted after the second, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Keyword arguments are the ones whose meaning is not dictated by their location, but by a special word (keyword) used to identify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The end and sep parameters can be used for formatting the output of the print() function. The sep parameter specifies the separator between the outputted arguments (e.g., print(\"H\", \"E\", \"L\", \"L\", \"O\", sep=\"-\"), whereas the end parameter specifies what to print at the end of the print statement."

    "1. Comments can be used to leave additional information in code. They are omitted at runtime. The information left in source code is addressed to human readers. In Python, a comment is a piece of text that begins with #. The comment extends to the end of line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you want to place a comment that spans several lines, you need to place # in front of them all. Moreover, you can use a comment to mark a piece of code that is not needed at the moment (see the last line of the snippet below), e.g.:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Whenever possible and justified, you should give self-commenting names to variables, e.g., if you're using two variables to store a length and width of something, the variable names length and width may be a better choice than myvar1 and myvar2.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It's important to use comments to make programs easier to understand, and to use readable and meaningful variable names in code. However, it's equally important not to use variable names that are confusing, or leave comments that contain wrong or incorrect information!\n",
    "\n",
